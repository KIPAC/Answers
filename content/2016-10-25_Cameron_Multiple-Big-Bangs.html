<!-- Is there a possibility that multiple big bangs occurred before and after our big bang? -->

<p>Your question can be addressed via two different considerations. The first
considers the long-term past and future of our observable universe. Before
the mid-1990’s, the expansion of the universe had been known about for
decades, and with that the theory that our universe began with a Big Bang.
One seriously considered possibility was that the universe contained
enough gravitating matter to eventually stop its expansion in the distant
future, and reverse it into universal contraction, ultimately resulting in
the universe collapsing to an event called the “Big Crunch”. And where the
Big Crunch might be followed by another Big Bang, thus repeating a cycle
in an on-going sequence of Big Bangs and Big Crunches for the universe.
However, since the mid-1990’s, astronomical observations have shown that
the expansion of our universe is actually accelerating, because of a
mysterious Dark Energy, and not decelerating. So that our observable
universe will not end in a Big Crunch.</p>

<p>As a second approach to considering your question, more recent
observational data support a model where our universe went through a phase
of very rapid inflation in its very early history. We have quite solid
observational data and models to explain the evolution of our universe
from about 10^-15 seconds after its origin, and efforts are underway in
both experiment and theory to seek understanding at even earlier times.
But this successful model of inflation in the very early universe has
led to theories of “perpetual inflation” beyond our observable universe,
and to theoretical models of a multiverse of which our observable
universe would be just one part, and in which other universes are
continually emerging from analogs of our Big Bang.</p>
