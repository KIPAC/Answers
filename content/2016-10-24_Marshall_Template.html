<!-- Template Answer - replace with your question! -->

<p>Add your answer text here, in 1-3 paragraphs. Start with a short answer in the first paragraph, and then use other paragraphs to provide more detail and context. It will be most helpful if you write each paragraph as a single, long line - that way it will paste well into the drupal page, and come out well-formatted.</p>

<p>For example, you might want to provide a reference, and explain why it is a good one.</p>

<p>You may also want to say something about why this is a good question, and how thinking about it helps us think about the Universe - or about the way we do science.</p>
