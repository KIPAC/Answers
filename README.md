# Questions and Answers

At KIPAC we love good questions. This repo hosts the questions that the public ask us about astrophysics and cosmology, and our attempts to answer them. 
The results are posted to the KIPAC webpage, on the ["Questions and Answers" page](), and also to the KIPAC blog (where we have a bit more space to explain ourselves).

If you have a question you would like the scientists at KIPAC to answer, please see the [How to ask a question]() section below.

If you are a KIPAC scientist helping out with this project, please see the guidelines below in the [How each question is answered]() section.
